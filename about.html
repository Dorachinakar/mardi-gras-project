            <h3>
                Traditional colors
            </h3>
            <p>
                The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The
                colors
                were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural
                parade
                in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these
                specific
                colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic
                appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.

                Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that
                the
                colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may
                have
                been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while
                white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that
                a
                flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that
                metals
                (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or
                next
                to other colors.

                Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
                around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
                symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green,
                and
                gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.
            </p>
            <h3>Costumes and masks</h3>
            <p>In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat
                Tuesday
                (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity
                with a mask
                are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns
                (such as
                convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.</p>

            <h3>Public nudity

            </h3>
            <p>Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented
                since 1889, when
                the Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on
                the
                streets." Risqué costumes, including body painting, is fairly common. The practice of exposing female
                breasts in
                exchange for Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area.
                In
                the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on
                balconies
                cause crowds to form on the streets.

                In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs
                helped
                encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social
                scientists studying
                "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or
                other
                favors.</p>

                    <h2>Political career</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace
                        term-limited mayor Mitch
                        Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell
                        garnered the most votes,
                        winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow
                        Democratic opponent Desiree
                        Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead
                        New Orleans in its 300-year
                        history,as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in
                        the city's history.
                        Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                        creating a strategic plan to
                        address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
                        Council, tasked with finding
                        solutions to violent crime.Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within
                        the city for city
                        use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure,
                        public transportation, public
                        parks, and green spaces.As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans
                        filed a lawsuit
                        against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.

                        During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                        Agreement with Governor
                        John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million
                        in upfront funding for
                        the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the
                        city. Following the
                        approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved three of the four
                        proposals Mayor Cantrell and the
                        City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million
                        bond sale and a tax on
                        short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under
                        the New Orleans Home Rule
                        Charter.
